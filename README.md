# WeatherDash
An application based on the "OpenWeather One Call" API. Input a city and check your weather based on the input. 

# About
A basic application that will display a 5-day forecast based on a user input of an existing city across the globe. This application makes use of an API called "OpenWeather One Call" to pull information on the temperature, wind speed, and humidity of the inputted city and will create the 5-day forecast. The application also takes log of previously inputted cities and will display it under the search bar. This is a coding bootcamp project made from scratch to test my ability to use APIs in an application.
